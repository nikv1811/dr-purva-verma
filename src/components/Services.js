        description: 'Strengthen Bones, Prevent Fractures Ayurveda offers a natural and holistic approach to promoting bone health and preventing fractures. Dr. Purva Verma, a leading Ayurveda practitioner in Kolkata, emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong bones through Ayurvedic therapies and lifestyle modifications. Dietary Support: A balanced diet rich in calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D is essential for bone strength.

These herbs not only nourish the bones but also reduce inflammation, helping prevent conditions like osteoporosis. Lifestyle Practices: Regular physical activity, such as yoga and stretching exercises, improves flexibility, balance, and bone strength, reducing the risk of fractures. Dr. Verma advises incorporating these activities into your daily routine to maintain joint and bone health. Ayurvedic Oils and Therapies: External applications of herbal oils such as Dhanwantharam Thailam and Mahanarayan Oil provide deep nourishment to the bones and joints.
